# Ergonode development docker

This is only a development solution! Do not use it on production environments!

## How the hell should I install it all ?!

At first you must install Docker and Docker Compose (https://docs.docker.com/compose).

Next, you must clone frontend and backend and docs repositories to ergonode directory:

```bash
mkdir ergonode
cd ergonode
git clone git@github.com:ergonode/docker.git
git clone git@github.com:ergonode/frontend.git
git clone git@github.com:ergonode/backend.git
git clone git@github.com:ergonode/docs.git
```

Next, you will need to enter docker directory and copy ``.env.dist``

```bash
cd docker
cp .env.dist .env
```

If you want to test ergonode in multiple directories you need to change in the  `.env` file
COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME env var to some unique value

Remember to setup correct ports in backend and frontend application.

Now you can start start docker by simple command

```bash
docker-compose up
```

Enjoy :)
